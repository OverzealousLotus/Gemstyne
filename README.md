### Description
Gemstyne is a personal mod, which seeks to expand the underground of Minecraft. Primarily, anything to do with cave exploration, or discovery of ores, minerals, ect cetera. I have no plans to add anything other than that, nor do I plan to change such restrictions. If I am ever to make a mod outside of Gemstyne, then it may possibly add trees, and other such things. At the moment, Gemstyne is small, and works with common performance mods used by Fabric clients. However, compatibility with other mods could cause problems, as I have not tested any for myself.
